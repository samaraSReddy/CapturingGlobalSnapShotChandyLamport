1.The unzipped tar syerram1-project2.tar.gz file contains the following files
a.ReadMe 
b.controller directory  
c.branch directory 
d.gen-java containing the generated java stub code for branch.thrift 
e.MakeFile to compile the controller and branch source code  

controller directory:  controller will contain the
a. src directory-->   1. Controller.java 2. BranchRecieveHandler.java 3.BranchClientHandler.java  4.BranchServer.java
b. controller.sh --> Executable to run the controller

branch directory: branch will contain 
a. src directory --> 1. Controller.java 2. BranchRecieveHandler.java 3.BranchClientHandler.java  4.BranchServer.java
b. branch.sh -->  Executable to run the branch 
 


Implementation (Programming Language : java):

1. Branch implementation : A TthreadpoolServer server with handler is created to handle transfer,initialize branch, initiate snapshot reciever marker and 
retrieve snapshot requests from controller and other branches. The branch automatically transfers money to other servers schedules in time between
o to 5 seconds amounts of 1-5 percent of initial balances. Branch will also function as client to send requests to other branches. 



2. Controller implementation :  Controller will initialize all the branches with balances and also trigger the snapshot to random branches 
and collects the snapshots regularly and displays to console.  



Steps to execute the distributed banking system to capture global snapshot.

Step1:
How to compile :

1.On running the command "make" in the location of directory where MakeFile is found the source code is 
compiled and  classes are put into respective controller/bin and branch/bin directories.
	
	
Step:2
How to Run branches:

1. navigate into the   "branch" directory 
2. Run the command "./branch.sh branchName portNo"  

Example run the branches on remote04.cs.binghamton.edu : 

"./branch.sh branch1 8088"

"./branch.sh branch2 8089"

"./branch.sh branch3 8090"


sample output of branch server:
Running branch1 on ip 128.226.180.163 port No: 8088
Starting the TThreadPoolServer server...




Step3 :
How to run the controller:	

1.Create input file to give the branches input  to the controller inside controller directory. 
Let input file be branches.txt 

1. command to run the controller "./controller.sh amount(Integer)  fileName(eg: branches.txt)" 

./controller.sh 300 branches.txt 


Sample snapshots:


Initiating snapshot for branch3 with snapshot no :1

Retrieving snapshot from branch1
{ branch1  100} {branch2->branch1  0} {branch3->branch1  0}
Retrieving snapshot from branch2
{ branch2  100} {branch1->branch2  0} {branch3->branch2  0}
Retrieving snapshot from branch3
{ branch3  100} {branch1->branch3  0} {branch2->branch3  0}

Initiating snapshot for branch1 with snapshot no :2

Retrieving snapshot from branch1
{ branch1  95} {branch2->branch1  0} {branch3->branch1  0}
Retrieving snapshot from branch2
{ branch2  96} {branch1->branch2  0} {branch3->branch2  0}
Retrieving snapshot from branch3
{ branch3  109} {branch1->branch3  0} {branch2->branch3  0}
